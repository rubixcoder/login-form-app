# LoginFormApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.15.

## Steps to run app

`npm install` // To install all the dependencies

`ng serve` // This will run your application on port 4200. Visit http://localhost:4200

## Running unit tests

`ng test`
`ng test --code-coverage` // To run unit tests with code coverage report

## What to improve
Currently I have not used Ngrx in the application because I didn't see much use of it, if we add more pages then we can implement that as well.
Unit tests can be improved to have more code coverage and better test scenarios.
We can add Dockerfile to create docker image and then we can create a docker-compose file as well to run both frontend and backer services.
